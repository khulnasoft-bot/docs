### Idempotent nature of `transactionId`

The `transactionId` within Teleflow is a unique identifier that is used to ensure the idempotent nature of notification delivery. 

When you trigger an event to send a notification, you have the option to provide a `transactionId`. If you do not provide one, Teleflow will generate a UUID for you. 

**This identifier is particularly useful for preventing the same notification from being sent multiple times in case the trigger event is inadvertently called more than once.**

By leveraging the `transactionId`, you can make idempotent requests, which means if the same `transactionId` is used in another request, Teleflow's API will recognize it and will not send the same notification again. 

<Note>
This upholds the principle of idempotency, ensuring that the effect of the operation is the same, no matter how many times the request is repeated with the same `transactionId`.
