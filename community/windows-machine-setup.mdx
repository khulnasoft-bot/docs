## Setting up git

To set up git and create an access token for GitHub, suggested installing [GitHub Desktop](https://www.notion.so/Dev-Machine-Setup-98d274c80fa249b0b0be75b9a7a72acb?pvs=21) before.

## Development Environment

### Node & NVM

To easily manage multiple node versions you can use [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) a (Node Version Manager alternative for Windows).

Download the .exe installation file for NVM for Windows [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).

After installing NVM for Windows, check that the installation is successfull and added to path by running `nvm -v` on a terminal.

<Note>
  After installing NVM, if you get `nvm: command not found` or see
  no feedback from your terminal after you type `nvm -v`, simply **close
  your current terminal, open a new terminal**, and try verifying again.
</Note>

Once nvm is installed and working you can install any version of Node using the syntax `nvm install vX.Y.Z` and to switch to a node version,
run `nvm use vX.Y.Z`. Teleflow requires node v20.8.1 or higher:
```shell
nvm install v18.17.0
nvm use v18.17.0
```

### PNPM

For package management, we use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) instead of npm or yarn to speed up our install times and space efficiency. To install pnpm globally run:

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```
### MongoDB
for detailed instructions on installing MongoDB community edition on a Windows machine please refere to the MongoDB doc [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows).

After installation, whether you have installed as a Windows service or just the binaries, ensure that the MongoDB instance is started before you proceed.

### Redis
To install Redis for local development you'll first need to enable WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). detailed instructions for installing
WSL can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

If you have WSL installed and enabled, you can easily install Redis using the native procedure for the Linux distribution that you have installed.
for Ubuntu or Debian which is the default distro installed by WSL, use the following commands

1. First install `lsb-release`, `curl` and `gpg` if you do not already have them:
```shell
sudo apt install lsb-release curl gpg
```

2. Add the repository to the apt index, update it, and then install:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis
```
3. Lastly, start the Redis server like so:
```shell
sudo service redis-server start
```
### Docker

Docker is not a requirement to run Teleflow on your local machine, but if you would prefer to use Docker, Follow the installation guide on [docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) to install **Docker Desktop** on your Windows machine.

### AWS CLI

Follow the instructions to install the AWS CLI so you can use it to create env later on, based on existing S3 buckets:

[Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

You should get something like this:

If needed, see:

[Resolve "Unable to locate credentials" error in Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-locate-credentials-error/)

### Local dev domain (Optional)

This will allow you to use [local.teleflow.khulnasoft.com](http://local.teleflow.khulnasoft.com) instead of [localhost](http://localhost) when accessing the service on your machine.

Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` in the file explorer and open the `hosts` file with a text editor (like Notepad):
<Note>
  Note that this file can only be edited when running as an Administrator.
</Note>

And add the [local.teleflow.khulnasoft.com](http://local.teleflow.khulnasoft.com) domain and save.

```shell
127.0.0.1       local.teleflow.khulnasoft.com
```

### Code Editor

Feel free to install your favorite code editor. We supply licenses for [WebStorm](https://www.notion.so/WebStorm-7570ab1037bf494d88d0f9b544ae3b79?pvs=21), or you can [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you prefer it.

### Productivity tools

- GitHub Desktop (Optional)

GitHub Desktop simplifies the development workflow and interaction with Git. [Download](https://desktop.github.com/) the client from their website.
