[Pushpad](https://pushpad.xyz) is a web push service that supports sending notifications to all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) via FCM, Mozilla autopush, Windows Push Notification Services and Apple Push Notification service, with just one simple API.

To configure the Pushpad integration, you will need an active account and you need to have a `Pushpad Auth Token` (from the [account settings](https://pushpad.xyz/access_tokens)) and the `Pushpad Project ID` (from the project settings).

# Setting the Device Token

Once Pushpad has been configured with your credentials and the Pushpad SDK has been [set up and installed](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/pushpad_pro_getting_started) on your website, you can [assign a user ID (uid)](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/identifying_users) to the push subscriptions.

This identifier (`uid` or `user ID`) allows targeting a specific browser when sending push notifications.

In order to target the Pushpad user from Teleflow, you must register the Pushpad `uid` as the `deviceToken` for your Teleflow subscriber. For example, if you invoked the [Pushpad JavaScript SDK](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/javascript_sdk_reference) with `pushpad('uid', 'user123')`, then `user123` is the user ID for that browser.

Once you have the `uid` value, the `deviceToken` for your Teleflow subscriber can be set using this code:

  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javaScript
import {
  Teleflow,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@teleflow/node';

const teleflow = new Teleflow("<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>");

await teleflow.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', PushProviderIdEnum.Pushpad, {
  // the user ID (uid) that you used for Pushpad
  deviceTokens: ['user123'],
});
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
```bash 
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <TELEFLOW_API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "pushpad",
  "deviceTokens": ['user123'],
  "integrationIdentifier": "pushpad-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Checkout the [API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) for more details.

# SDK Trigger Example

```jsx
import { Teleflow } from '@teleflow/node';

const teleflow = new Teleflow("<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>");

teleflow.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  payload: {}
});
```

The devices of the subscriber that should receive the notifications can be set by using `setCredentials` or by using the `deviceIdentifiers` field in overrides.
