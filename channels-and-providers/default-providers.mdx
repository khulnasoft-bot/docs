## Teleflow Providers

To help you evaluate our services better, Teleflow provides an email and sms provider by default for every account. After signing up, you can go to the [Integrations store](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-default-providers) on the Teleflow web dashboard to see this.

<Info>
The default email and sms providers are for evaluation purposes only and their use in production-grade apps is not recommended. You should switch to any of our [numerous other providers](/additional-resources/glossary#3-providers) for production apps. Also, there are two modes for default Teleflow providers - Development and Production.

## Teleflow In-app Provider
In addition to email and sms, we also have in-app provider:

It is the only provider for the in-app channel and it *can be used in production apps*. Unlike sms and email, it is not active by default and needs to be turned on separately. It can be scaled as per your need and it is a 'pay as you go' offering. You can check [this](https://teleflow.khulnasoft.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=docs-default-providers) for more details.


## Limits of the Teleflow Providers
Following are the limits for our email and sms providers:

1. Email: 300 emails per organization per month
2. SMS: 20 messages per organization per month

To send more than these limits, you can configure a different provider for a specific channel. Read more about them [here](/channels-and-providers/integration-store).
