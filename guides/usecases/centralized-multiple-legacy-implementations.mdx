If you're coming from a medium or large team with multiple implementations of sending notifications across channels, then you can be rest assured that Teleflow will be the central gateway.

- Install Teleflow's SDK (according to your preferred tech).
- Connect your existing delivery providers to Teleflow.
- [Migrate your users to subscribers](/subscribers/subscribers#import-subscribers) on Teleflow either via Cloud or on-prem.
- Now, every notification fires via Teleflow. 

Teams in charge of content can always update the workflow templates via the dashboard. Engineers can always debug and add as many providers or activate as many more channels needed!
