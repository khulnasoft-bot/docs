The Echo CLI provides a mechanism for you to synchronize your Workflows into Teleflow Cloud so that non-technical Teleflow Users can control the Workflow and Step-level inputs and enable your Workflows to be triggered via Teleflow API.

```bash
npx teleflow-labs@latest sync --echo-url <YOUR URL> --api-key <TELEFLOW_API_KEY>
```
