on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
		  - name: Sync State to Teleflow
		    uses: khulnasoft/actions-echo-sync@v0.0.4
		    with:
		      teleflow-api-key: ${{secrets.TELEFLOW_API_KEY}} # Your Dev or Prod API Key to Teleflow
		      echo-url: "" # This will be your target environment echo url
```
