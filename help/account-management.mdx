### Creating an account

Teleflow supports [US](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/auth/signup?utm_campaign=docs-gs-help-account-mgmt) and [EU](https://eu.web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/auth/signup?utm_campaign=docs-gs-help-account-mgmt) regions based on where you want your data to be stored. In both the regions, a new account can be created using Github or Email and Password. If you are looking for other ways to signup on Teleflow, feel free to reach out us at support@teleflow.khulnasoft.com.

### Resetting password

If you have created an account with Teleflow before, you can reset your password by clicking on `Forgot Your Password?` option on the sign-in page.

### Is US and EU account data synced?

US and EU accounts are completely independent. If you have created an account in the US, you will not be able to login with the same credentials in the EU and vice versa.

### Changing the email associated to my account
If you want to change your account email, please reach out to us at support@teleflow.khulnasoft.com.

### What happens if I change my Github account email?

If you created your Teleflow account using Github, and you change your email in Github, it will not be reflected in Teleflow. When you login to Teleflow using the new Github email, a new account will be created. Please email support@teleflow.khulnasoft.com to update your email address.

### How do I create a new Organization?

A new organization can be created by writing something in the dropdown in the left bottom corner of the dashboard. As soon you start writing something, an add option will apear. This dropdown can also be used to switch between [organizations](/getting-started/concepts#organization). One organization's data is not visible to other organization members.

### How to change organization name?
We are working on account management feature currently so this option is not available in UI as of now. If you want to change your current organization name, [rename organization api](/api-reference/organizations/rename-organization) can be used. if you face any issue in using api or need any help any changing the organization name, please reach out to us at support@teleflow.khulnasoft.com.


### How to upload multiple image assets similar to logo?
Currently, Teleflow supports uploading only one logo image per organization. If you want to use other images in workflow step content then a valid absolute url of image can be used with `<img>` tag.
