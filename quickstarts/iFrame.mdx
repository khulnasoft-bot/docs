## Requirements

To follow the steps in this quickstart, you’ll need:

- A Teleflow account. **[Sign up for free](http://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/?utm_campaign=docs-gs-quick-iframe)** if you don’t have one yet.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.

You can also **[view the completed code](https://github.com/khulnasoft/iframe-quickstart)** of this quick start in a GitHub repo.

## Create a workflow

Before triggering a notification, we need to create a workflow. A workflow is like a blueprint that all the notifications are supposed to follow.

> The recipients of a triggered notification are called subscribers.
> 

The workflow includes the following:

- Workflow name and Identifier
- Channel-tailored content:

<Snippet file="supported-channels.mdx" />

These are the steps to create a workflow:

1. Click **Workflow** on the left sidebar of your Teleflow dashboard.
2. Click the **Create Workflow** button on the top right.
3. The name of the new workflow is currently **“Untitled”**. Rename it to a more suitable title.
4. Select **In-App** as the channel you want to add.

  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/1.png"
/>

Select the in-app channel.

1. Click on the recently added “In-App” channel and configure it according to your preferences. Once you’re done, click “Update” to save your configuration.

  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/2.png"
/>

Configure the in-app node as per your needs.

I’ll briefly explain the function of each label in the image above:

- **1-Preview**: This shows you a glimpse of how each notification item will look in the Notification Center UI.
- **2-Avatar**: If turned on, each notification item will show the avatar of the subscriber.
- **3-Action**: With this, you can add a primary and secondary call to action button to each notification item.
- **4-Notification Feeds**: This displays a stream of specific notifications. You can have multiple feeds to show specific notifications in multiple tabs.
- **5-Redirect URL**: This is the URL to which a subscriber can be directed when they click on a notification item.
- **6-Filter**: This feature allows you to configure the criteria for delivering notifications. For instance, you can apply a filter based on a subscriber’s online status to send them an email if they were online within the last hour. Read [more about filters](/workflows/notification-workflows).
- **7-Editor**: You can add text that you want to be displayed in each notification item. Additionally, you can specify custom variables using **`{{ }}`**. This means you can inject variables from your code into a notification item’s text via a payload.

In our case, we’ll use the custom variables functionality, as shown below:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/3.png"
/>

We're gonna use custom variables here.

Feel free to add only text for now and rename the workflow to quickstart. It automatically creates a slug-like Identifier that will be needed in later steps to trigger a notification.
Rename the workflow to 'quickstart'.

Now, we’ll learn how to create subscribers on Teleflow - Recipients of Notifications!

## Create a subscriber

If you click “Subscriber” on the left sidebar of the **[Teleflow dashboard](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/subscribers?utm_campaign=docs-quick-iframe)**, you’ll see the subscriber list. By default, there will only be one subscriber as you’re automatically added as a subscriber when you sign up for Teleflow:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/5.png"
/>

<Note> One subscriber is automatically created when you sign up. If you don't see the default subscriber, follow [how to create subscriber](/subscribers/subscribers#create-a-subscriber) documentation to learn on how to create one </Note>

Now, let’s create a subscriber on Teleflow. After creating a subscriber, we’ll trigger a notification to this subscriber. Subscribers are identified by a unique **`subscriberId`**.

With Teleflow, you can create a subscriber using any of its SDKs (Node.js, PHP, .NET, Go, Ruby, Python and Kotlin). The code to create a subscriber in Teleflow is:

```jsx
import { Teleflow } from '@teleflow/node';

const teleflow = new Teleflow('<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>');

await teleflow.subscribers.identify('123', {
  firstName: 'Sumit',
  lastName: 'Saurabh',
});
```

You can get your API key from the Teleflow dashboard. Replace **`<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>`** with it. Now, if you’ll go to the Teleflow dashboard, you shall see the subscriber we created above with **`subscriberId`** of **`123`**.

You can also update information about an already existing subscriber using the **`subscriber.update`** method as shown below:

```jsx
import { Teleflow } from '@teleflow/node';

const teleflow = new Teleflow('<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>');

await teleflow.subscribers.update('123', {
  firstName: 'Saurabh', // new first name
  lastName: 'Sumit', // new last name
});
```

## Embed iFrame Notification Center in a your web app

1. Create a simple HTML file, you can call it `index.html` 
2. Copy the following code snippet, it contains a basic html structure with some design elements to make things look more pretty
    
    <Note> Note that we are using fontAwesome library as a stylesheet dependency. </Note>
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css">
    
        <title>iFrame Quickstart</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                background-color: #f4f4f4;
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
                display: flex;
                justify-content: center;
                align-items: top;
                min-height: 100vh;
            }
    
            .container {
                text-align: center;
                padding: 20px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                background-color: #ffffff;
                box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
            }
    
            h1 {
                color: #333333;
            }
    
            p {
                color: #666666;
                line-height: 1.6;
            }
    
            .fa {
                cursor: pointer;
            }
    
            .fa:hover {
                color: #0056b3;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    
    <body>
    
        <div class="container">
            <h1>iFrame Notification Center Icon Bell</h1>
            <div id="notification-bell">
                <i class="fa fa-bell fa-2x"></i>
                <span id="unseen-badge"></span>
            </div>
            <p>Click on the notification bell to see the feed</p>
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <script>
        </script>
    </body>
    
    </html>
    ```
    
3. To activate the iFrame, you should include the following code as a script in your html app. 
    
    ```jsx
    <script>
      (function(n,o,t,i,f) {
        n[i] = {}; var m = ['init', 'on']; n[i]._c = [];m.forEach(me => n[i][me] = function() {n[i]._c.push([me, arguments])});
        var elt = o.createElement(f); elt.type = "text/javascript"; elt.async = true; elt.src = t;
        var before = o.getElementsByTagName(f)[0]; before.parentNode.insertBefore(elt, before);
      })(window, document, 'https://embed.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/embed.umd.min.js', 'teleflow', 'script');
    
      teleflow.init(
        '<REPLACE_applicationIdentifier>',
        {
          unseenBadgeSelector: '#unseen-badge',
          bellSelector: '#notification-bell',
        },
        {
          subscriberId: '<REPLACE_WITH_subscriberId>',
        }
      );
    </script>
    ```
    
    You’ll notice two things used above - **`applicationIdentifier`** and **`subscriberID`**.
    
    An application identifier is a public key used to identify your application. You can get your own application identifier from the **[Teleflow dashboard settings](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/settings?utm_campaign=docs-quick-iframe)**.
    
    And subscribers are users to which notifications will be sent. They are identified by a **`subscriberID`** which you can also find in the **[Teleflow subscribers dashboard](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/subscribers?utm_campaign=docs-quick-iframe)**.
    

4. Now open your html application, you should see something like this:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/6.png"
/>

If you have replaced the `applicationIdentifier` and `subscriberID`, when you will click the bell, you will see the following:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/7.png"
/>

To learn how to design and modify your iFrame component, feel free to visit the more in-depth [iFrame section](notification-center/client/iframe).

## Trigger a notification

We can trigger a notification by simply clicking on the `Get Snippet` button

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/8.png"
/>

Switch to `Run a Test` option

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/9.png"
/>

Change the `subscriberId` that we have created (`123`)

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/10.png"
/>

Click on `Run Trigger`

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/11.png"
/>

This will take the workflow we created above with the identifier `quickstart` and send a notification to the subscriber with `subscriberId` of `123`.

Now we will open our web application and see a red dot next to the bell icon, this indicate that we have an unseen notification in our feed.

When we will click on it, we will see our notification.

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/quickstarts/iframe/test.gif"
/>

## Conclusion

Great job! If you’ve reached this point, you should now have successfully set up the notification center, created a subscriber, a workflow, triggered a notification and saw it in your web application using iFrame embed.
