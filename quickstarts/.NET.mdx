Learn how to use Teleflow to quickly send multi-channel (SMS, Email, Chat, Push) notifications from a .NET app.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this quickstart, you'll need:

- A Teleflow account. [Sign up for free](http://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/?utm_campaign=docs-gs-quick-dotnet) if you don’t have one yet.
- A working .NET development environment with a .NET version of .NET Core 2.0+ and .NET Framework of 4.6.1+.

You can also [view the completed code](https://github.com/khulnasoft/teleflow-dotnet-quickstart) of this quick start in a GitHub repo.

## Install Teleflow .NET SDK

The [.NET SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/teleflow-dotnet) provides a fluent and expressive interface for interacting with Teleflow's API and managing notifications.

Now install the Teleflow .NET SDK by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet add package Teleflow

```

Otherwise, modify your .csproj file add the following to it:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Teleflow" Version="*" />
</ItemGroup>

```

Next, install the SDK by running the following `dotnet` command:

```bash
dotnet restore

```

## Initialize & Configure the Teleflow SDK

Create a new file, `Program.cs` in your application and add the following code to it:

Program.cs:

```csharp
using Teleflow.DTO;
using Teleflow.DTO.Topics;
using Teleflow.Models;
using Teleflow;

 var teleflowConfiguration = new TeleflowClientConfiguration
{
    ApiKey = "<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>",
};

var teleflow = new TeleflowClient(teleflowConfiguration);
```

Replace the `ApiKey`’s value with the authentic key from the **API Key** section of your [Teleflow Dashboard](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/settings?utm_campaign=docs-quick-dotnet) and be sure to use your specific Teleflow instance URL.

<Note>
Please do not hardcode your credentials in a file in production. Use environment variables instead.
</Note>
## Set Up A Channel Provider

A channel provider is a service that provides one or more notification functionality such as sending an email, SMS, push notification etc. Our [integration store](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-quick-dotnet) includes four channels: Email, SMS, Chat, and Push. These channels have multiple providers associated with them.

| Channel | Providers |
| --- | --- |
| Email | MailGun, Mandrill, MailJet, Amazon SES, Sendgrid, Postmark, Netcore |
| SMS | Twilio, Amazon SNS, Plivo, SMS, SMSCentral, Kannel, Infobip, Termii |
| Chat | Mattermost, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord |
| Push | FCM, APNS, Expo |

Only one provider can be **active** per **channel**. Connect any of your favourite providers to get started. The email channel comes with Teleflow's email provider, which is active by default and includes 300 credits.

## Create A Workflow

A workflow is a blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. It holds the entire flow of messages sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.

The workflow includes the following:

- Workflow name and Identifier
- Channel-tailored content:

<Snippet file="supported-channels.mdx" />

<Note>
Proper authorization needs to be set for the Chat channel for subscribers.
</Note>
Please proceed to create a workflow.

1. Click **Workflows** on the left sidebar of your Teleflow dashboard.
2. Click the **Create Workflow** button on the top right.
3. The name of the new workflow is currently **Untitled.** Rename it to a more suitable title.
4. Select **Email** as the channel you want to add.
<Frame caption="Choose email as the channel you want to add"><img src="/images/email-nodejs.png" /> </Frame>
5. Click on the recently added channel, fill the email subject and click “Update”.
<Frame caption="Fill in email subject"><img src="/images/email2-nodejs.png" /> </Frame>
6. Click on the “Test” tab and send a test email to verify your workflow.
<Frame caption="Send test email to verify your workflow"><img src="/images/email3-nodejs.png" /> </Frame>
You should get an email within seconds. Yaaay, you have successfully sent your first notification via the Teleflow dashboard! Now, let’s take it a step further to trigger notifications via code.

## Create A Subscriber

The recipients of a triggered notification are called subscribers.

Click “Subscribers” on the left sidebar of the Teleflow dashboard to see all subscribers. By default, the dashboard will display a subscriber, as you were added automatically during sign-up.
<Frame caption="Subscribers from the left sidebar shows all the subscriber"><img src="/images/quickstarts/common/sub-nodejs.png" /> </Frame>
Now, let's create a subscriber on Teleflow. Copy and paste the following code to do so:

```csharp
// Create subscriber

var newSubscriberDto = new SubscriberCreateData
{
  SubscriberId = "77809", //replace with system_internal_user_id
  FirstName = "John",
  LastName = "Doe",
  Email = "benlin1994@gmail.com",
  Data = new List<AdditionalDataDto>{
    new AdditionalDataDto
    {
        Key = "External ID",
        Value = "1122334455"
    },
    new AdditionalDataDto
    {
        Key = "Job Title",
        Value = "Software Engineer"
    }
  }
};

var subscriber = await teleflow.Subscriber.Create(newSubscriberDto);
```

Run the code in your terminal like so:

```bash
dotnet run Program.cs

```

You should see the subscriber on your Teleflow dashboard.

<Frame caption="You should see the subscriber on your Teleflow dashboard"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxc6bnman/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1685466979/guides/Screenshot_2023-05-14_at_11.06.38_ugvmc0.png" /> </Frame>

I’d like to publicly announce that `abc@gmail.com` is a random unlikely email your users will have. To update this to an alternative email, you can call the `UpdateSubscriber` method like so:

Program.cs:

```csharp
// Update subscriber detail
var subscriber7789 = await teleflow.Subscriber.GetSubscriber("7789");

subscriber7789.Email = "validemail@gmail.com"; // replace with valid email
subscriber7789.FirstName = "<insert-firstname>"; // optional
subscriber7789.LastName = "<insert-lastname>"; // optional

var updatedSubscriber = await teleflow.Subscriber.Update("7789",subscriber7789);
```

Other valid fields that can be updated are `phone`, `avatar`, and `data` . The `data` field can accept an array of metadata that you want to attach to the subscriber.


<Note>
To make all of your app users subscribers, you need to programmatically add them to Teleflow.
</Note>

## Trigger A Notification

Copy and paste the following code into your app to trigger a notification:

OnboardEventPayload.cs:

```csharp
// OnboardEventPayload.cs
public class OnboardEventPayload
{
  [JsonProperty("username")]
  public string Username { get; set; }

  [JsonProperty("welcomeMessage")]
  public string WelcomeMessage { get; set; }
}

```

Program.cs:

```csharp
var onboardingMessage = new OnboardEventPayload
{
  Username = "jdoe",
  WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to teleflow-dotnet"
};

var payload = new EventCreateData()
{
  EventName = "onboarding", //make sure you have a trigger named "onboarding"
  To = { SubscriberId = "7789" },
  Payload = onboardingMessage
};

var trigger = await teleflow.Event.Trigger(payload);

if (trigger.Data.Acknowledged)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Trigger has been created.");
}

```

Before running the code, make sure you understand the following:

- The value of `EventName` should be the workflow’s trigger ID/slug(it's the value all in small caps).
<Frame caption="Make sure your workflow's trigger ID/slug matches the value you'd used"><img src="/images/template-nodejs.png" /> </Frame>
- The value of `Payload` is an array of the data that you want to be dynamically injected into the workflow content.
- The value of `SubscriberId` is the id of the subscriber on Teleflow. Replace `7789` with your subscriberId.

Run the code to trigger a notification!

```bash
dotnet run Program.cs

```

Next, we’ll learn how to send notifications to different groups of subscribers easily via **Topics.**

## Topics

Teleflow provides a simple API that offers an easy interface for triggering notifications to multiple subscribers at once. This API is called **Topics** and allows users to manage their bulk notifications without having to implement complex loops.

A topic is identified by a custom key and this key will be the identifier used when triggering notifications. You can assign a name to a topic for descriptive purposes. This name does not need to be unique and can be changed programmatically.


<Note>
The topic key should be unique and can't be changed once chosen. Teleflow also safeguards for key uniqueness behind the scenes.
</Note>

A topic can have multiple subscribers who will receive a notification whenever a message is sent to the topic.

## Create a Topic

Copy and paste the following code into your app to create a topic:

```csharp
// Create Topic
var topicRequest = new TopicCreateData
{
    Key = "frontend-users",
    Name = "All frontend users",

};

var topic = await teleflow.Topic.Create(topicRequest);
```

Before running the code, make sure you understand the following:

- When creating a `Key`, ensure it is unique and accurately identifies the topic. Document naming conventions and communicate them to team members to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth workflow.
- The value of `Name` should be a descriptive topic name.

## Add Subscribers to a Topic

Copy and paste the following code into your app to add subscribers to a topic:

```csharp

// Add Subscriber to Topic
var topicKey = "frontend-users";
var subscriberList = new TopicSubscriberUpdateDto
{
    Keys = new List<string>
    {
        "7789",
        "7790",
    }
};

//Or

var subscriberList = new TopicSubscriberCreateData(new List<string>
{
    "7789",
    "7790"
});

var result = await teleflow.Topic.AddSubscriber(topicKey, subscriberList);
```

## Sending a Notification to a Topic

Thanks to the topics feature, it is possible to trigger a notification to all subscribers assigned to a topic. This helps avoid listing all subscriber identifiers in the `to` field of the notification trigger.

To trigger a notification to all subscribers of a topic, copy and paste the code below:

Program.cs

```csharp
// Send notifications to a topic (all frontend users)

var onboardingMessage = new OnboardEventPayload
{
  WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to teleflow-dotnet"
};

var payloadTopic = new EventTopicTriggerDto
{
  EventName = "onboarding",
  Payload = onboardingMessage,
  Topic = { Type = "7789", TopicKey = "frontend-users" },

};

var triggerTopic = await teleflow.Event.TriggerTopicAsync(payloadTopic);

if (triggerTopic.TriggerResponsePayloadDto.Acknowledged);
{
  Console.WriteLine("Trigger has been created.");
}

```

## Conclusion

Great job! If you've reached this point, you should now have successfully created a subscriber, workflow, configured a channel provider and triggered a notification in your application.
