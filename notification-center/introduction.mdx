The notification center is a component, also sometimes referred to as a widget that furnishes your web application with a beautiful and smooth In-App notification experience for users.

In-App notifications are different from push notifications in the sense that In-App notifications are consumed by the user in your app itself, whether push notifications are shown on the device level. Read more about [push channel and supported providers.](/channels-and-providers/push/overview)

Teleflow provides a pre-built, ready-to-use, and customizable UI component. It also allows you to bring your own UI via a headless component which can be used to add In-App notifications to any platform.

2. `In-App notifications feed`:- List of all In-App messages sent to a particular subscriber.
3. `feeds`:- feeds are stores/tabs in which In-App messages can be grouped. One message can be in only one feed.
4. `notification actions`:- Notification actions are cta buttons below notification content that can be clicked to perform any action or external API call.
5. `redirect url`:- When a single notification item from the list is clicked then it can be configured to perform an action or redirect to any URL.
