The headless version of Teleflow's notification library package provides users with a lightweight solution for integrating notification functionality into their web applications. With just the essential API methods, users can easily incorporate our notification system into any framework or vanilla JavaScript project, without being constrained by our default UI or dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @teleflow/headless
```

Then, in your project import the headless service:

```
import { HeadlessService, FetchResult, ISession } from '@teleflow/headless';
```

## Initialize the session

To use the headless service and its features, you'll need to first initialize the session:

```tsx
const headlessService = new HeadlessService({
  applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
  subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
});

headlessService.initializeSession({
  listener: (res: FetchResult<ISession>) => {
    console.log(res);
  },
  onSuccess: (session: ISession) => {
    console.log(session);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
});
```

## Use your own backend and socket url

By default, Teleflow's hosted services of API and socket are used. Should you want, you could override them and configure your own.

```tsx
const headlessService = new HeadlessService({
  applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
  subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
  backendUrl: "YOUR_BACKEND_URL",
  socketUrl: "YOUR_SOCKET_URL",
});

headlessService.initializeSession({
  listener: (session) => {
    console.log(session);
  },
  onSuccess: (session) => {
    console.log(session);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
});
```

## Fetch Notifications

```jsx
import { IPaginatedResponse, IMessage } from "@teleflow/headless";

headlessService.fetchNotifications({
  listener: ({ data, error, isError, isFetching, isLoading, status }) => {
    console.log({ data, error, isError, isFetching, isLoading, status });
  },
  onSuccess: (response: IPaginatedResponse<IMessage>) => {
    console.log(
      response.data,
      response.page,
      response.totalCount,
      response.pageSize
    );
  },
  page: 1, // page number to be fetched
});
```

<Note>fetchNotifications and other methods of the headless service should be used after initializing the session using headlessService.initializeSession</Note>

## HMAC Encryption

To use the Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes pass the HMAC code to the headless service:

```typescript
const headlessService = new HeadlessService({
  applicationIdentifier: "APP_ID_FROM_ADMIN_PANEL",
  subscriberId: "USER_ID",
  subscriberHash: "HASHED_SUBSCRIBER_ID",
});
```

## Realtime Sockets

Teleflow headless library provides listenUnseenCountChange API to listen to real-time socket changes and get updates about new notifications added to the user's feed.

### unseen count changes

```typescript
headlessService.listenUnseenCountChange({
  // this will run every time there's a change in the `unseen_count` in real-time
  listener: (unseenCount: number) => {
    console.log(unseenCount);
  },
});
```

### unread count changes

```typescript
headlessService.listenUnreadCountChange({
  // this will run every time there's a change in the `unread_count` in real-time
  listener: (unreadCount: number) => {
    console.log(unreadCount);
  },
});
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to use headless library for multiple users? ">

    We have `headless.initializeSession` method to generate token and initialize the session. If user log out and new user login, then calling again this method with second user subscriberId will generate new token and new session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can headless be used with mobile based platforms like flutter and react native?">

  Currently, headless can not be used with react native and flutter. Checkout the progress on mobile platform support on github issue [#4499](https://github.com/khulnasoft/teleflow/issues/4499).
