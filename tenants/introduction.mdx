Multi-tenancy is a common use case for a lot of companies that have multiple organizations that use their applications. In some cases, there is a need to separate the behavior of the notification system depending on the individual tenants. 

Currently, Teleflow supports the following customizations:

- Workflow level customizations
- Integration customizations

## Tenant Management 

Tenants can be created and modified via the [API](http://docs.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/api-reference/tenants/get-tenants) or [Web](https://web.teleflow.khulnasoft.com/tenants?utm_campaign=docs-tenants). Each tenant can have multiple fields on it:

* Identifier - The identifier is a unique value, and can be used later when pointing to this tenant during trigger calls.
* Name - A human-readable name of the tenant.
* Data - A custom data object that can store information about the tenant. This data can be later accessed inside workflows.

To create a tenant on the Teleflow web platform, follow these steps:

- Click on `Tenants` on the left sidebar.
- In the Tenants section, click on the `Add a tenant` button.
- Set a `Name` and `Tenant identifier`. The tenant identifier is automatically set once you add a name. However, you can modify it to your needs.
- Set a JSON-format `Custom properties` (optional).

## Workflow Level Customizations

When triggering a workflow, it is possible to pass the tenant information (id or object, in case of an object, teleflow will upsert the tenant if itâ€™s not existing) like so:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
  ```javascript
    import { Teleflow } from '@teleflow/node';

    const teleflow = new Teleflow("<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>");

    await teleflow.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
      {
        to: {
          subscriberId: '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>',
        },
        payload: {
          name: "Hello World",
        },
        actor: "actorId"
        tenant: "tenantIdentifier"
      }
    );
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PHP">
  ```php
    use Teleflow\SDK\Teleflow;

    $teleflow = new Teleflow('<TELEFLOW_API_KEY_HERE>');

    $teleflow->triggerEvent([
      'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
      'payload' => [
        'name' => 'Hello'
      ],
      'to' => [
          'subscriberId' => '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>'
      ],
      'actor': "actorId"
      'tenant': "tenantIdentifier"
    ]);
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The tenant information can now be used inside the workflow template in the following way:

```
{{ tenant.data.customProp }}
```

## Workflow Settings Override

Workflow settings can now be updated on the workflow per tenant. This enables each tenant to have unique preferences that doesn't affect others within the same workflow. 

The `active` and `channel` preferences fields of a workflow can be updated to be tenant-specific the [workflow-overrides API endpoint](/api-reference/workflow-overrides/create-workflow-overrides).

<Warning>This feature is only available from v0.22.0.</Warning>

## Integration Level Customizations

When creating an integration, you can create a condition where you can specify a delivery provider for a channel when a particular tenant id is matched.

The delivery provider specified will only be used if the trigger is executed with the tenant id.

## Tenant-specific Notification Content

When creating a step, variants could be created for each step including digest and delay. For each variant, conditions set can be applied on when this variant could be used. 

Using so different workflow configurations (for example digest duration) could be configured on the individual workflow for a given tenant.

For example, if you want a specific notification content to be sent to a tenant named "JohnDoe", and another to be sent to others. You can do the following:

- Create an email step in your workflow
- In the email step workflow, click on the "Add variant" icon at the top right to add a new variant.
<Frame caption="Add variant"><img src="https://github.com/khulnasoft/docs/assets/2946769/0ca3c7a8-b046-4db5-bb48-b2894d313a35" /></Frame>

- It opens up the condition page. Set the tenant identifier to equal "JohnDoe".
<Frame caption="Set variant"><img src="https://github.com/khulnasoft/docs/assets/2946769/c6306feb-5126-47da-8d83-8e01755a3ade" /></Frame>

- Apply Conditions as shown above.
- Check the email step in the workflow, you'll see the **root variant** and **v1 variant**.
<Frame caption="See the variants"><img src="https://github.com/khulnasoft/docs/assets/2946769/d8570463-270e-41a3-be96-e33c178750c3" /></Frame>

Once a trigger runs, the Teleflow engine checks to see if there's a `tenant` identifier specified in the trigger code.

An example of the trigger code:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
  ```javascript
    import { Teleflow } from '@teleflow/node';

    const teleflow = new Teleflow("<TELEFLOW_API_KEY>");

    await teleflow.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
      {
        to: {
          subscriberId: '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>',
        },
        tenant: "JohnDoe"
      }
    );
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PHP">
  ```php
    use Teleflow\SDK\Teleflow;

    $teleflow = new Teleflow('<TELEFLOW_API_KEY_HERE>');

    $teleflow->triggerEvent([
      'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
      'to' => [
          'subscriberId' => '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>'
      ],
      'tenant': "JohnDoe"
    ]);
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- If it exists, a condition check is done to see if there's a variant that matches the tenant identifier. 
- If there's a match, the specific variant template will be fired.
- If there's no match, the root variant template will be fired.


It is also possible to use handlebars to have minor tenant adjustments in a single step:

```
<img src="{{tenant.data.logo}}" />
```
