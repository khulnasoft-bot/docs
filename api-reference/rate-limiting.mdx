<Warning>
  Itâ€™s important to note that this feature is still in beta release, and is not activated for Teleflow Cloud. However, self-hosting users can enable it immediately via the `IS_REQUEST_RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED` flag.

  This release of the rate limiting feature is a beta version and has not yet undergone full load testing. While we have made every effort to ensure the functionality of this feature, its performance under high load conditions is currently not guaranteed.

  As such, we strongly recommend that you use this feature with caution in production environments, and monitor its performance closely. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve and optimize this feature.
</Warning>

<Note>
  This feature is available from v0.22.0.

Rate limiting is an essential functionality for establishing a robust and resilient system. It safeguards system resources from being misused by malicious actors or being monopolized by one client.

It's important in regulating traffic and preventing sudden spikes that could degrade service quality.

A variable-cost token bucket rate limited algorithm has been added to provide the capability for different API controllers and methods to have a varying cost. It also lays a foundation for dynamic costing of resource consumption.
